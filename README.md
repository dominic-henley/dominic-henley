Hi, I'm @dominic-henley.

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Melbourne, currently studying Computing and Software Systems in the Bachelor of Science.

I have experience in Python, Java, SQL and C. This place will be a compilation of projects I have worked on, as a way to reflect on my progress.

I'm particularly interested in cybersecurity, and data science.
