Hi, I'm @dominic-henley.

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Melbourne, majoring in Computing and Software Systems in the Bachelor of Science.

I have experience in Javascript, Python, Java, SQL, C, C++ and C#. This place will be a compilation of projects I have worked on, as a way to reflect on my progress.

Most of my industry experience is in Web Development, using Javascript, VueJS, Python and FastAPI to build web applications. I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge in several fields, mainly in Cybersecurity and Web Development.

Currently, I'm learning NextJS, along with some Game Development. Sometimes I post writeups on CTF challenges, as a way to measure how much I've learned.
